validated using 
validation controls (RequiredFieldValidator and RegularExpressionValidator). 
These controls automatically use unobtrusive validation. 
Unobtrusive validation allows the validation controls to use JavaScript for client-side validation logic, 
which means the page does not require a trip to the server to be validated. 
By default, unobtrusive validation is included in the Web.config file based on the following configuration setting:

<add key="ValidationSettings:UnobtrusiveValidationMode" value="WebForms" />
